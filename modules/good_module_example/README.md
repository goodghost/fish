Good Module Example
===================

This is an example for good quality Drupal module, coded in functional way
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and in some areas
using OOP methodology. The goal of this exercise is to AVOID STATE and
HIDDEN DEPENDENCIES that are so overwhelmingly present in Drupal modules.

STATE and HIDDEN DEPENDENCIES makes most Drupal modules almost impossible
to properly test. There's no place for such modules here, so please do follow
this example very carefully.
